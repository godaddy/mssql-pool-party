/**
* Class representing a ConnectionPoolParty, which manages one or more ConnectionPool instance(s).
* ConnectionPoolParty extends the mssql package to provide failover between ConnectionPools,
* reconnets/retries, and basic health/statistics reporting.
* @param {object} config - Configuration for ConnectionPoolParty
* @param {number} [config.reconnects=0] - The number of times a request will be retried
*  against ALL pools. A heal operation is attempted before a reconnect. Total request
*  attempts is calculated using: pools * (1+reconnects) * (1+retries)
* @param {number} [config.retries=0] - The number of times a request will be retried against
*  a single pool.  Each pool is retried separately. Total request attempts is calculated using:
*  pools * (1+reconnects) * (1+retries)
* @param {object} [config.dsn] - A single DSN, matches the configuration object expected
*  by the mssql package. Required if dsns and dsnProvider are not provided.
* @param {array} [config.dsns] - An array of DSNs, each entry should match the configuraiton
*  object expected by the mssql package. Overrides config.dsn. Required if dsn and dsnProvider
*  are not provided.
* @param {function} [config.dsnProvider] - A function returning a promise that resolves
*  with an array of dsn object(s). This option will override config.dsn and config.dsns.
*  Required if dsn and dsns are not provided.
* @param {function} [config.connectionPoolFactory] - A function that receives the dsn objects
*  from the dnsProvider and returns a promise that resolves with *connected* instance(s) of
*  ConnectionPool. Use this option if you want to customize how mssql ConnectionPools are
*  instantiated and connected.
* @param {object} [config.connectionPoolConfig] - An object containing any configuration
*  you want to attach to the config provided when creating an mssql ConnectionPool. This is
*  useful if you don't want to create a custom dsnProvider or connectionPoolFactory to modify
*  the configuration used to create ConnectionPools. Just keep in mind that any config set here
*  will override the config set in the dsnProvider. Also keep in mind that node-mssql expects some
*  configuration to exists on an "options" property (like timeouts). Check node-mssql README.md
*  for more information.
* @param {boolean} [config.prioritizePools] - A flag to enable pool prioritization behavior.
*  If you enable this behavior, your dsns must have a numeric priority property.
*  The lower the number, the higher the priority of the dsn, starting at 0.
*  At a specified interval, the pools collection will be examined to see if the pools
*  are no longer indexed in order of priority. If this is the case, the pools will be
*  healed (if applicable) and re-ordered in terms of their priority. This is a useful
*  behavior if you want to fail back to a "primary" dsn after it becomes healthy again.
* @param {number} [config.prioritizeInterval=30000] - The interval in milliseconds
*  to run the pool prioritization check. Setting a value below 10000 is not advised,
*  as the pool prioritization check can take significant resources if a pool heal is required.
* @param {function} [cb] - Optional callback interface, providing this automatically calls
*  warmup. It is preferable to use the Promise-based interface and call warmup explicitly.
* @class
* @extends EventEmitter
* @memberof module:connection-pool-party
