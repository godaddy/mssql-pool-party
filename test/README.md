# Integration Tests

The tests in this directory require specially configured mssql instances accessible on `localhost:1433` and `localhost:1434`. A helpful Dockerfile has been included in the project that will accomplish this, along with a script to make sure the image is built and the containers are running before the tests start. If you don't have Docker for Windows/Mac installed, you won't be able to run these tests.

## Running integration tests

```sh
npm run test:docker
npm run test:integration
npm run test:docker-stop
```

Or, to run all tests:

```sh
npm run test:all
```

## Gotchas

- Make sure you meet the [requirements](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/mssql-server-linux/) mentioned for the mssql-server-linux Docker image.

- The coverage reports seem to be a little broken. `jest` can't combine coverage across multiple runs natively (and we need multiple runs due to having a few tests that can't be run in parallel). We use `nyc` to combine and report on the json coverage files generated by jest, but the numbers seem off. And html/lcov reports didn't seem to work.
